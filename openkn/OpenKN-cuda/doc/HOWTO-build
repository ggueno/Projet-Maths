#OpenKraken-cuda HOWTO-build

***
Simple build
***
To start configuration and generation of makefiles, go to source directory and run:

cmake .
make
make install

The dot means that it should use current directory as a root of the build. If configuration will end without errors CMake will also generate makefiles, otherwise it will show some errors. The problems usually lie in not being able to set some variables automatically - in that case you can specify them manually. 


***
Out-of-source build - Recommended
***

This build option is good especially for developers as it allows building several different configurations with the same sources. E.g. you can build either debug / release version, use dynamic / static linking and more options. To use out-of-source build just create a directory where it will get built - nothing complicated:

cd build
cmake ..
make
make install

Another benefit is that it's easy to delete the whole build just by deleting its directory.
