Please read the Howtos in doc/HOWTO-*

Special recommandations for LIN_V4L2Webcam :
Sometimes, under Linux, the webcam could turns out of control. You will have to unplug and replug the webcam to get back to normal.
If you nocite luminosity problems (dark image, white image, brightness, exposure, etc.), you can also use this method. However, it can be useless due to uvcvideo driver limits so a solution is to restart the driver :
 - sudo rmmod uvcvideo
 - sudo modprobe uvcvideo

Special recommandations for LIN_DVCam :
If your program reports an error caused by the firewire port then you will have to check if /dev/dv1394/* and /dev/raw1394 have permission level for everyone. Otherwise you will have to do :
 - sudo chmod 777 /dev/dv1394/*
 - sudo chmod 777 /dev/raw1394

About Tests :
You have three kinds of tests :
 - make (webcam and exceptions)
 - make dvcam (DVCam)
 - make wiimote (Wiimote)
